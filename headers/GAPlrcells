## It contains the allocation to the variable coxeter_lrcells of the list
## of all two-sided Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in the group. Each cell is sorted
## w.r.t the shortlex normal form order (for the natural ordering of the
## generators used in GAP, unless you have changed that), and the cells
## are written in the order of their first elements. All the printouts
## relating to two-sided cells, two-sided cell ordering, are consistent with 
## this choice of ordering.
