## All group elements are represented by their shortlex normal forms in
## the GAP conventions (unless you did something to change that).
##
## This file contains what is the geometrical data for the schubert cell
## corresponding to one element y in the group. It contains the following
## allocations :
##
##   coxeter_currentElement : the element y;
##   coxeter_criticalPairs : the list of all x s.t. (x,y) is a critical
##     pair, together with the corresponding k-l polynomial (as a polynomial
##     in q = u^2);
##   coxeter_slocus : the (rational) singular locus, a sublist of
##     coxeter_criticalPairs;
##   coxeter_sstratification : for each polynomial P != 1 which occurs 
##     among the P_{x,y}, we look a the x s.t. P_{x,y} = P and which are 
##     maximal in the Bruhat ordering; this is another sublist of 
##     coxeter_criticalPairs;
##   coxeter_betti : the ordinary betti numbers;
##   coxeter_ihbetti : the intersection homology betti numbers;
##
## Look at the header files and/or help functions for the commands extremals,
## slocus, sstratification, betti and ihbetti for more details on these
## concepts.
