#
# The file contains the full left W-graph of the current context. This
# contains all the edges of the W-graph which lie in the context; so it
# is guaranteed to be a W-graph only when the current context is the full 
# group; otherwise it is the user's responsibility either to ensure that he 
# is dealing with a context which is a union of left cells, or to get what 
# he can from the partial graph.
#
# The group elements are sorted in shortlex order for the current ordering of 
# the generators. We start with a list of the shortLex normal forms of the
# elements in the context, one per line, sorted in ShortLex order. Then
# one line is printed for each element in the context; it starts with the
# brace-enclosed descent set of the element, followed by a colon and a
# brace-enclosed, comma-separated list of pairs of the form (destination, 
# mu-coefficient) representing the edges of the graph originating from the 
# current element; here the destination is just the number of the destination 
# vertex in the ShortLex numbering that we use (starting from 0.)
#
# The two lists are separated by a comment line "# graph", in order to
# facilitate parsing.
