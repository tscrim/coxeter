The "lcells" command prints out the full list of left cells of the group,
with the corresponding W-graphs.

The numbering of the cells in all the cell commands is consistent; the lists
that are printed are always printed in the same ordering (corresponding to
the shortlex ordering of the first element in the cell, in the standard
enumeration of the generators.)
