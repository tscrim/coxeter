The "coatoms" command prints out the coatoms of a given element x in the group.
Recall that these are the z < x which are of length one less than x; so the
set of coatoms is empty iff x is the identity element (in terms of posets,
these are the coatoms of the poset [e,x], for the Bruhat ordering.) It is 
known that the number of coatoms is at least equal to the cardinality of the 
support of x. Finding good upper bounds (when such exist) for any given
group is much more difficult.
