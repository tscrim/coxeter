You are currently in mode type_m. This is an artificial mode, intended
for that brief span in time where the type is set, but not the rank. If
you got stuck in this mode, it's because you answered to the Rank: prompt
with a carriage return. To continue, you should simply say "rank" again to 
set the rank for the current type, or say "type" if you also want to reset 
the type.
