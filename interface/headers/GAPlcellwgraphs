## This file contains the list of the W-graphs for the various left
## Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in the group. Each cell is sorted w.r.t the shortlex 
## normal form order (for the natural ordering of the generators used in GAP, 
## unless you have changed that), and the cells are written in the order of
## their first elements.
##
## The file contains the allocation to the variable coxeter_lcwgraphs of a list
## of W-graphs, one for each left cell, which are output as the for the full
## left W-graph of the group, viz. as a list of pairs [descent set, edge list],
## one pair for each node in the cell. The edge-list is again a list of pairs
## [dest,mu], where dest is the destination node of the edge, and mu the 
## corresponding mu-coefficient. Nodes are numbered from 1, as is customary
## in GAP.
