# This file contains the printout of the maximal elements in the set of
# x < y s.t. P_{x,y} != 1. In the case where W is crystallographic, these
# correspond to the irreducible components of the rational singular locus
# of the Schubert variety X_y.
#
# Generators in the group are represented by decimal numbers 1,2, ... ;
# the format for outputting group elements as words is the same as for
# GAP, viz. prefix "[", separator ",", postfix "]"; so for instance a word
# in three generators that would be written as 12321 in our usual "really
# terse" style will be written here as [1,2,3,2,1].
#
# Polynomials are represented in dense representation, as a list of
# coefficients, starting with the coefficient in degree zero. Lists
# are comma-separated and enclosed in parentheses. Polynomials may
# be preceded by a modifier of the form (d,m); this means that X^d
# has to be substituted in the polynomial, and that the result should
# be multiplied by X^m; in particular, this is how Laurent polynomials
# are obtained. An absent modifier is equivalent to the modifier (1,0).
