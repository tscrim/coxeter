  This file tells where the directories can be found which contain some
  auxiliary files used by the program. The following directories are defined :

    - COXMATRIX_DIR : contains the files for predefined Coxeter matrices;
      these are the files that are loaded through the "X" group type.

    - HEADER_DIR : contains headers for the output to files done by some
      of the commands.

    - MESSAGE_DIR : contains the text of various error and warning messages.
      This is used mostly by the help facility, and also in some of the
      error handling.
