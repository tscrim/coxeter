Given an element y in the group, the "slocus" command prints out the maximal
elements of the set of x <= y s.t. P_{x,y} != 1 (in the case of Weyl groups,
this is known to be a decreasing subset of [e,y]). These correspond to the
irreducible components of the (rational) singular locus of the Schubert
variety defined by y (in the case of Weyl groups).
